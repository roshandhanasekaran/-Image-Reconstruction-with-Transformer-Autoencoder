# -Image-Reconstruction-with-Transformer-Autoencoder

Description: This project implements a transformer autoencoder to reconstruct images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained on a sequence of flattened image features and uses positional encoding to capture the spatial relationships between pixels. The encoder and decoder models are implemented with custom transformer layers and batch normalization, and the model is trained with the AdamW optimizer and early stopping for better convergence. The average test loss is reported as a performance metric, and the reconstructed images are visualized to assess the model's performance. The project is implemented in Python using the PyTorch deep learning framework.

Uses: This project has potential applications in image compression, data augmentation, and data recovery. By reconstructing images from a compressed representation, it can reduce the storage space and transmission bandwidth required for image data while preserving image quality. Additionally, it can generate new, plausible images by perturbing the encoded representation or by sampling from the learned distribution. The project can also be extended to other datasets or image modalities with appropriate adjustments to the model architecture and hyperparameters.
